### Technical Questions

**Question:** *Should I be concerned if I see Throttling Errors in my ADF Pipelines?*

**Answer:** No, throttling errors are normal and by itself is not alarming. Throttling is expected. As long as the data is copied over and verified we should not be alarmed. As long as the overall job performance is acceptable then there is no worries.
