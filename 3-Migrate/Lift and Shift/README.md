Lift and Shift Copy Pattern Guide: A quick start template
=========================================================

## Overview

The purpose of this document is to provide a manual in form of step by step guide for the lift and shift copy pattern from Gen1 to Gen2 storage using Azure Data Factory and PowerShell. As such it provides the directions, references, sample code examples of the PowerShell functions been used. 

This guide covers the following tasks:

   * Set up kit for lift and shift copy pattern from Gen1 to Gen2 

   * Data Validation between Gen1 and Gen2 post migration  
   
   * Application update for the workloads
   
Considerations for using the lift and shift pattern
 
   ✔️ Cutover from Gen1 to Gen2 for all workloads at the same time.

   ✔️ Expect downtime during the migration and the cutover period.

   ✔️ Ideal for pipelines that can afford downtime and all apps can be upgraded at one time.

   * **Application**: This folder will have sample code for Mount path configuration.

   * **Configuration**: This folder will have the configuration file [FullLoadConfig.json](https://github.com/Azure/adlsgen1togen2migration/tree/main/3-Migrate/Lift%20and%20Shift/Configuration) and all the required details of resource group and subscription along with source and destination path of ADLS Gen1 and Gen2.
     
   * **Migration**: Contains the templates to create dynamic data factory pipeline and copy the data from Gen1 to Gen2.
 
   * **Validation**: Contains the PowerShell scripts which will read the Gen1 and Gen2 data and write the comparison report post migration.
 
   * **[StartFullLoadMigrationAndValidation.ps1](https://github.com/Azure/adlsgen1togen2migration/blob/main/3-Migrate/Lift%20and%20Shift/StartFullLoadMigrationAndValidation.ps1)**: Script to invoke the full load Migration and Validation process to compare the data between Gen1 and Gen2 post migration and generate summary report.
  
### How to Set up Configuration file

   **Important Prerequisite**: 

   * Provide Service principal access to configure key vault as below:
   
   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62353482/79594064-3e2d7080-8091-11ea-872e-d69052da0ff7.png)
     
   * Make an entry of Gen2 Access key in the key vault as shown below :

   ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62353482/78953831-f1dda180-7a8e-11ea-82e9-07aa66fd2856.png)
   
   **Below is the code snapshot for setting the configuration file to connect to azure data factory**:
     
  ```powershell
  
            "gen1SourceRootPath" : "https://<<Enter the Gen1 source root path>>.azuredatalakestore.net/webhdfs/v1", 
	    "gen2DestinationRootPath" : "https://<<Enter the Gen2 destination root path>>.dfs.core.windows.net", 
	    "tenantId" : "<<Enter the tenantId>>", 
	    "subscriptionId" : "<<Enter the subscriptionId>>", 
	    "servicePrincipleId" : "<<Enter the servicePrincipleId>>", 
	    "servicePrincipleSecret" : "<<Enter the servicePrincipleSecret Key>>", 
	    "keyVaultName" : "<<Enter the keyVaultName>>",
	    "factoryName" : "<<Enter the factoryName>>", 
	    "resourceGroupName" : "<<Enter the resourceGroupName under which the azure data factory pipeline will be created>>",
	    "location" : "<<Enter the location>>", 
	    "overwrite" : "Enter the value" //  True = It will overwrite the existing data factory ,False = It will skip creating data factory
  ```

  **Setting up the factory pipeline for lift and shift copy pattern**

   ```powershell

	   "pipelineId": "<<Enter the pipeline number. For example: 1,2"
	   "fullLoad": "true"
  
            // Activity 1 
 	   
	    "sourcePath" : "Enter the Gen1 full path. For example: /path-name",
	    "destinationPath" : "Enter the Gen2 full path. For example: path-name",
	    "destinationContainer" : "Enter the Gen2 container name"
           
	   // Activity 2 
            
	    "sourcePath" : "Enter the Gen1 full path. For example: /path-name",
	    "destinationPath" : "Enter the Gen2 full path. For example: path-name",
	    "destinationContainer" : "Enter the Gen2 container name"
   ```
 
  **NOTE**: The **destinationPath** string should not have the Gen2 Container name. It will have the file path same as Gen1.  
   Path to [FullLoadConfig.json](https://github.com/Azure/adlsgen1togen2migration/blob/main/3-Migrate/Lift%20and%20Shift/Configuration/FullLoadConfig.json) script for more reference.
 
 ### Azure data factory pipeline creation and execution

   Run the script [StartFullLoadMigrationAndValidation.ps1](https://github.com/Azure/adlsgen1togen2migration/blob/main/3-Migrate/Lift%20and%20Shift/StartFullLoadMigrationAndValidation.ps1) which will trigger the migration and validation process. This step will create the data factory as per the configuration file.

 ### Azure Data factory pipeline monitoring

  The pipeline is created in Azure data factory and can be monitored in below way:
 
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62353482/83555204-c8eff080-a4c2-11ea-8162-a8f86b5e9e9e.png)

 
 ## Data Validation 

  The [script](https://github.com/Azure/adlsgen1togen2migration/blob/main/3-Migrate/Lift%20and%20Shift/StartFullLoadMigrationAndValidation.ps1) triggers the data validation process between Gen1 and Gen2 once the **migration is completed** in above step.  
 
 To monitor the execution details for each copy activity, select the Details link (eyeglasses image) under Actions in the activity monitoring view. You can monitor details like the volume of data copied from the source to the sink, data throughput, execution steps with corresponding duration, and used configurations.

 **Verify that the data is copied into your Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account**.
     
  ### Data Comparison Report

  Once the Gen1 and Gen2 data is compared and validated, the result is generated in CSV file into the **Output** folder as below:

  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62353482/83555444-26843d00-a4c3-11ea-9fac-5bd0760aca0b.png)

  The CSV file will show the matched and unmatched records with file path, file size, Permission for Gen1 and Gen2 records and Ismatching status.

  **Note**: IsMatching status = Yes (For matched records ) and No (For Unmatched records)

## Application update  

 This step will configure the path in the workloads to Gen2 endpoint. 
 
 Refer to [Application and Workload Update](https://github.com/Azure/adlsgen1togen2migration/tree/main/4-Post-Migration/Update%20Your%20Workloads%20and%20Applications) on how to plan and migrate workloads and applications to Gen2.
