===================================================

## Overview
This article summarizes the behavioral differences of the access control models for Data Lake Storage Gen1 and Gen2.

✔️ Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 implements an access control model that derives from HDFS, which in turn derives from the POSIX access control model.
